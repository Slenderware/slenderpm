Slenderware was created for the purpose of bridging the divide between the project and the customer. 
Part of the Slenderware Management System is to track a project every step of the way. 
This provides managers with the ability to quickly and easily report the status of projects and ascertain whether they are on the right track or if their not. 
Projects fail due to lack of information, here the Slenderware Project Management software includes functions to add details to a project like 'parts' that need to be built.
